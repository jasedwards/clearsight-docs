This flag will be considered only if hasManager flag is selected\n\n\n\nApart from these flags the cs-feature schematic asks a question about the type of manager this feature would have. The available options are:\nManager Type selection:\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nNo Manager\nSchematic doesn't create any manager\n\n\nDefault Manager\nCreates a default manager\n\n\nDomain based Split Manager\nCreates a domain based split manager\n\n\nDefault Split Manager\nCreates a split manager\n\n\nFolder Manager (New)\nCreates a folder manager page\n\n\nFolder Manager and Default Manager (New)\nCreates a folder manager and default manager page\n\n\n\nThis command will create new library under clearsight app.\nTo connect a library to an app\nAdd Routes to your app.module.ts to load your library feature:\nexport const MY_ROUTES: Routes = [\n  {\n    path: 'yourpath',\n    loadChildren: () => import('@clearsight-apps/my-feature').then(m => m.MyFeatureModule)\n  }\n];And then pass in the routes to RouterModule.forRoot:\nRouterModule.forRoot(MY_ROUTES, { initialNavigation: 'disabled' })To create a left hand nav\nAdd a nav-routing-nav instance to your app.component.html:\nThen in your app.component.ts create your navCommands array:\nnavCommands: NavCommand[] = [\n    { icon: 'cs-icon-home', text: 'STORMS_LBL_HOME', id: '/' },\n    { icon: 'cs-icon-your-icon', text: 'YOUR_NAV_ITEM_LABEL', id: '/yourpath' }\n  ];To pass routes up to Storms.Wrapper\nAdd AppNavigationModule to your app.module.ts and duplicate the same\nnavCommands array used for the nav-routing-nav component.\n\nNOTE: this will be refactored later to remove duplication.\n\nAppNavigationModule.forRoot([\n  { icon: 'cs-icon-home', text: 'STORMS_LBL_HOME', id: '/' },\n  { icon: 'cs-icon-your-icon', text: 'YOUR_NAV_ITEM_LABEL', id: '/yourpath' }\n]),To create a manager page in an app\nng g @schematics/clearsight:cs-manager MyManager --project 'app-name' --domainName `Domain.Name` --package `PackageName` --headerLabel `Dictionary Key`Arguments:\n\n\n\nArgument\nAlias\nDefault Value\nAllowed Values\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nargv\nnone\nnone\nany\nThe name of the manager (i.e. Claim)\n\n\n--domainName\n-dn\nnone\nany\nThe domain name\n\n\n--package\n-pkg\nnone\nany\nThe package name\n\n\n--headerLabel\n-hl\nnone\nany\nThe dictionary key to use as the header of the page\n\n\n--hasViews\nnone\ntrue\ntrue/false\nIf view lookup should be included in manger\n\n\n--hasSearch\nnone\ntrue\ntrue/false\nIf search component should be included in manger\n\n\n--routing (optional)\nnone\nnone\ntrue/false\nIf routing should be included.  If not the manager component is exported\n\n\n\nThis will actually generate a module, component and service needed for a manager page.\nTo create a Folder page in an app\nFollowing command will emit folder module under given project for specific domain and package\nng g @schematics/clearsight:cs-folder MyFolder --project 'app-name' --domainName `Domain.Name` --package `PackageName` --headerLabel `Dictionary Key`Arguments:\n\n\n\nArgument\nAlias\nDefault Value\nAllowed Values\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nargv\nnone\nnone\nany\nThe name of the folder (i.e. Claim)\n\n\n--domainName\n-dn\nnone\nany\nThe domain name\n\n\n--package\n-pkg\nnone\nany\nThe package name\n\n\n--headerLabel\n-hl\nnone\nany\nThe dictionary key to use as the header of the page\n\n\n\nNOTE: cs-folder schematics is still in progress and provide basic wireframe of folder component. Teams will be notified once folder schematics is ready to use.\nTo create a Folder Manager page in an app\nFollowing command will emit folder manager module under given project for specific domain and package\nng g @schematics/clearsight:cs-folder-manager  --project= --domainName=  --package= --headerLabel=`` --dry-run\nArguments:\n\n\n\nArgument\nAlias\nDefault Value\nAllowed Values\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nargv\nnone\nnone\nany\nThe name of the folder manager (i.e. tasks)\n\n\n--domainName\n-dn\nnone\nany\nThe domain name\n\n\n--package\n-pkg\nnone\nany\nThe package name\n\n\n--headerLabel\n-hl\nnone\nany\nThe dictionary key to use as the header of the page\n\n\n\nExample folder structure\n+ tasks-grid (Common Grid Control)\n|   +-- tasks-grid.component.html\n|   +-- tasks-grid.component.ts\n|   +-- tasks-grid.component.spec.ts\n|   +-- tasks-grid.component.scss\n\n+ tasks-manager (Default Manager)\n|   + state\n|       +-- tasks-manager.facade.ts\n|       +-- tasks-manager.effects.ts\n|       +-- tasks-manager.*\n|   +-- tasks-manager.component.html\n|   +-- tasks-manager.component.ts\n|   +-- tasks-manager.component.spec.ts\n|   +-- tasks-manager.component.scss\n\n+ tasks-folder-manager (Folder Manager)\n|   + state\n|       +-- tasks-folder-manager.facade.ts\n|       +-- tasks-folder-manager.effects.ts\n|       +-- tasks-folder-manager.*\n|   +-- tasks-folder-manager.component.html\n|   +-- tasks-folder-manager.component.ts\n|   +-- tasks-folder-manager.component.spec.ts\n|   +-- tasks-folder-manager.component.scss\n\nNOTE: If you are adding cs-folder-manager schematic to an existing \nfeature that has common grid control then choose 'Yes' to following \nquestion: \n\n\nDoes this feature already contains the common grid component? Yes. \n\nFiltering logic for the folder managers\nCommon approaches to filter the folder manager based on the parent's properties are:\nApproach #1: Use searchParms property in the GridSearch\nUse parentKey, parentField, parentPackageName, parentDomainName properties in the component html when the folder manager is added as a page to your entity folder\n    \n    Approach #2: Use attachedEntityDomain, attachedEntityKey attributes\nWhen there are some extra parameters to be sent to the GridSearch api then override the getExtraParamsForSearch method in the folder-manager's effect class\n    protected getExtraParamsForSearch(state: IFolderPageState) {\n        return {\n            attachedEntityDomain: state.ParentDomainName,\n            attachedEntityKey: state.ParentKey\n        };\n    }\nTo create a New Entiry page in an app\nng g @schematics/clearsight:cs-new-entity NewEntity --project 'app-name' --domainName `Domain.Name` --package `PackageName`Arguments:\n\n\n\nArgument\nAlias\nDefault Value\nAllowed Values\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nargv\nnone\nnone\nany\nThe name of the manager (i.e. NewClaim)\n\n\n--domainName\n-dn\nnone\nany\nThe domain name\n\n\n--package\n-pkg\nnone\nany\nThe package name\n\n\n\nTo create a empty State Module in an app\nIn case, you dont want to create manager/folder but just a custom components module which follow state model. For those cases, you can use cs-state-module schematics to create module with sample component which follows state model.\nng g @schematics/clearsight:cs-state-module MyModule --project 'app-name' --domainName `Domain.Name` --package `PackageName`Arguments:\n\n\n\nArgument\nAlias\nDefault Value\nAllowed Values\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nargv\nnone\nnone\nany\nThe name of the module (i.e. setting)\n\n\n--domainName\n-dn\nnone\nany\nThe domain name\n\n\n--package\n-pkg\nnone\nany\nThe package name\n\n\n\nCommands to know\nTo add a control to the control library:\nEach control should have it's own module.  this will allow the consumer to just add one control instead of the entire library.  When adding a new control you should follow these steps.\nWe will assume that your control name is MyControl\nng g module MyControl --app=controls\nng g component MyControl --app=controlsThe first command creates a MyControlModule file.  The second command adds a MyControlComponent to that folder.\nAfter that go to controls/controls.module.ts and add your new module to CONTROLS_MODULE array.  this will also allow the user to pull in all of the input controls\nTo create a component in an app (controls-demo...)\nng g c MyComponent --app controls-demo** serving an app **\nng serve --app myappbuilding all apps\nnpm run
