The prefix will always be first two letters of last word unless specified.\nwhile the style type defaults to scss a full list of parameters can be found here\nOnce the app is generated you should go to index.html and replace\nthis:\nwith this:\nYou will then go to app-loading.html and copy the contents into your index.html between your app component selector.\nOnce that is copied you will replace instances of  with with the rgb value of your app color (i.e. 1,2,3) and instances \nof  with your app color (i.e. #267aae)\nTo create a new library\nng g @schematics/clearsight:cs-lib  (i.e. ng g cs-schematics:cs-lib my-lib (or My.Lib) will create a library called my-lib)this creates a library.  At the moment it just calls the base schematic for library and then adds \nsome scripts to package.json.  you can get a full list of arguments here\nTo create a feature library\nIn most common scenarios, we need to build feature library around particular domain and package which includes manager page, folder page, folder manager page, new entity page and other related modules to that feature.\nYou can use cs-feature scematics for this purpose with different available options mentioned below which gives enough flexibility to include modules on required basis.\nng g @schematics/clearsight:cs-feature MyFeature --domainName `Domain.Name` --package `PackageName`\nHINT: use '--dry-run' option in case you just want to check the file > structure supposed to be emitted by the command instead of actual file > generation. \n\nArguments:\n\n\n\nArgument\nAlias\nDefault Value\nAllowed Values\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nargv\nnone\nnone\nany\nThe name of the feature (i.e. Claim)\n\n\n--domainName\n-dn\nnone\nany\nThe domain name\n\n\n--package\n-pkg\nnone\nany\nThe package name\n\n\n--headerLabel\n-hl\nnone\nany\nThe dictionary key to use as the header of the page\n\n\n--hasManager\nnone\ntrue\ntrue/false\nIf manager module should be included in the feature library\n\n\n--hasFolder\nnone\ntrue\ntrue/false\nIf Folder module should be included in the feature library\n\n\n--hasNewEntity\nnone\nfalse\ntrue/false\nIf New Entity module should be included in the feature library\n\n\n--hasViews\nnone\ntrue\ntrue/false\nIf view lookup should be included in manger. This flag will be considered only if hasManager flag is selected\n\n\n--hasSearch\nnone\ntrue\ntrue/false\nIf search component should be included in manger. This flag will be considered only if hasManager flag is selected\n\n\n\nApart from these flags the cs-feature schematic asks a question about the type of manager this feature would have. The available options are:\nManager Type selection:\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nNo Manager\nSchematic doesn't create any manager\n\n\nDefault Manager\nCreates a default manager\n\n\nDomain based Split Manager\nCreates a domain based split manager\n\n\nDefault Split Manager\nCreates a split manager\n\n\nFolder Manager (New)\nCreates a folder manager page\n\n\nFolder Manager and Default Manager (New)\nCreates a folder manager and default manager page\n\n\n\nThis command will create new library under clearsight app.\nTo connect a library to an app\nAdd Routes to your app.module.ts to load your library feature:\nexport const MY_ROUTES: Routes = [\n  {\n    path: 'yourpath',\n    loadChildren: () => import('@clearsight-apps/my-feature').then(m => m.MyFeatureModule)\n  }\n];And then pass in the routes to RouterModule.forRoot:\nRouterModule.forRoot(MY_ROUTES, { initialNavigation: 'disabled' })To create a left hand nav\nAdd a nav-routing-nav instance to your app.component.html:\nThen in your app.component.ts create your navCommands array:\nnavCommands: NavCommand[] = [\n    { icon: 'cs-icon-home', text: 'STORMS_LBL_HOME', id: '/' },\n    { icon: 'cs-icon-your-icon', text: 'YOUR_NAV_ITEM_LABEL', id: '/yourpath' }\n  ];To pass routes up to Storms.Wrapper\nAdd AppNavigationModule to your app.module.ts and duplicate the same\nnavCommands array used for the nav-routing-nav component.\n\nNOTE: this will be refactored later to remove duplication.\n\nAppNavigationModule.forRoot([\n  { icon: 'cs-icon-home', text: 'STORMS_LBL_HOME', id: '/' },\n  { icon: 'cs-icon-your-icon', text: 'YOUR_NAV_ITEM_LABEL', id: '/yourpath' }\n]),To create a manager page in an app\nng g @schematics/clearsight:cs-manager MyManager --project 'app-name' --domainName `Domain.Name` --package `PackageName` --headerLabel `Dictionary Key`Arguments:\n\n\n\nArgument\nAlias\nDefault Value\nAllowed Values\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nargv\nnone\nnone\nany\nThe name of the manager (i.e. Claim)\n\n\n--domainName\n-dn\nnone\nany\nThe domain name\n\n\n--package\n-pkg\nnone\nany\nThe package name\n\n\n--headerLabel\n-hl\nnone\nany\nThe dictionary key to use as the header of the page\n\n\n--hasViews\nnone\ntrue\ntrue/false\nIf view lookup should be included in manger\n\n\n--hasSearch\nnone\ntrue\ntrue/false\nIf search component should be included in manger\n\n\n--routing (optional)\nnone\nnone\ntrue/false\nIf routing should be included.  If not the manager component is exported\n\n\n\nThis will actually generate a module, component and service needed for a manager page.\nTo create a Folder page in an app\nFollowing command will emit folder module under given project for specific domain and package\nng g @schematics/clearsight:cs-folder MyFolder --project 'app-name' --domainName `Domain.Name` --package `PackageName` --headerLabel `Dictionary Key`Arguments:\n\n\n\nArgument\nAlias\nDefault Value\nAllowed Values\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nargv\nnone\nnone\nany\nThe name of the folder (i.e. Claim)\n\n\n--domainName\n-dn\nnone\nany\nThe domain name\n\n\n--package\n-pkg\nnone\nany\nThe package name\n\n\n--headerLabel\n-hl\nnone\nany\nThe dictionary key to use as the header of the page\n\n\n\nNOTE: cs-folder schematics is still in progress and provide basic wireframe of folder component. Teams will be notified once folder schematics is ready to use.\nTo create a Folder Manager page in an app\nFollowing command will emit folder manager module under given project for specific domain and package\nng g @schematics/clearsight:cs-folder-manager  --project= --domainName=  --package= --headerLabel=`` --dry-run\nArguments:\n\n\n\nArgument\nAlias\nDefault Value\nAllowed Values\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nargv\nnone\nnone\nany\nThe name of the folder manager (i.e. tasks)\n\n\n--domainName\n-dn\nnone\nany\nThe domain name\n\n\n--package\n-pkg\nnone\nany\nThe package name\n\n\n--headerLabel\n-hl\nnone\nany\nThe dictionary key to use as the header of the page\n\n\n\nExample folder structure\n+ tasks-grid (Common Grid Control)\n|   +-- tasks-grid.component.html\n|   +-- tasks-grid.component.ts\n|   +-- tasks-grid.component.spec.ts\n|   +-- tasks-grid.component.scss\n\n+ tasks-manager (Default Manager)\n|   + state\n|       +-- tasks-manager.facade.ts\n|       +-- tasks-manager.effects.ts\n|       +-- tasks-manager.*\n|   +-- tasks-manager.component.html\n|   +-- tasks-manager.component.ts\n|   +-- tasks-manager.component.spec.ts\n|   +-- tasks-manager.component.scss\n\n+ tasks-folder-manager (Folder Manager)\n|   + state\n|       +-- tasks-folder-manager.facade.ts\n|       +-- tasks-folder-manager.effects.ts\n|       +-- tasks-folder-manager.*\n|   +-- tasks-folder-manager.component.html\n|   +-- tasks-folder-manager.component.ts\n|   +-- tasks-folder-manager.component.spec.ts\n|   +-- tasks-folder-manager.component.scss\n\nNOTE: If you are adding cs-folder-manager schematic to an existing \nfeature that has common grid control then choose 'Yes' to following \nquestion: \n\n\nDoes this feature already contains the common grid component? Yes. \n\nFiltering logic for the folder managers\nCommon approaches to filter the folder manager based on the parent's properties are:\nApproach #1: Use searchParms property in the GridSearch\nUse parentKey, parentField, parentPackageName, parentDomainName properties in the component html when the folder manager is added as a page to your entity folder\n    \n    Approach #2: Use attachedEntityDomain, attachedEntityKey attributes\nWhen there are some extra parameters to be sent to the GridSearch api then override the getExtraParamsForSearch method in the folder-manager's effect class\n    protected getExtraParamsForSearch(state: IFolderPageState) {\n        return {\n            attachedEntityDomain: state.ParentDomainName,\n            attachedEntityKey: state.ParentKey\n        };\n    }\nTo create a New Entiry page in an app\nng g @schematics/clearsight:cs-new-entity NewEntity --project 'app-name' --domainName `Domain.Name` --package `PackageName`Arguments:\n\n\n\nArgument\nAlias\nDefault Value\nAllowed Values\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nargv\nnone\nnone\nany\nThe name of the manager (i.e. NewClaim)\n\n\n--domainName\n-dn\nnone\nany\nThe domain name\n\n\n--package\n-pkg\nnone\nany\nThe package name\n\n\n\nTo create a empty State Module in an app\nIn case, you dont want to create manager/folder but just a custom components module which follow state model. For those cases, you can use cs-state-module schematics to create module with sample component which follows state model.\nng g @schematics/clearsight:cs-state-module MyModule --project 'app-name' --domainName `Domain.Name` --package `PackageName`Arguments:\n\n\n\nArgument\nAlias\nDefault Value\nAllowed Values\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nargv\nnone\nnone\nany\nThe name of the module (i.e. setting)\n\n\n--domainName\n-dn\nnone\nany\nThe domain name\n\n\n--package\n-pkg\nnone\nany\nThe package name\n\n\n\nCommands to know\nTo add a control to the control library:\nEach control should have it's own module.  this will allow the consumer to just add one control instead of the entire library.  When adding a new control you should follow these steps.\nWe will assume that your control name is MyControl\nng g module MyControl --app=controls\nng g component MyControl --app=controlsThe first command creates a MyControlModule file.  The second command adds a MyControlComponent to that folder.\nAfter that go to controls/controls.module.ts and add your new module to CONTROLS_MODULE array.  this will also allow the user to pull in all of the input controls\nTo create a component in an app (controls-demo...)\nng g c MyComponent --app controls-demo** serving an app **\nng serve --app myappbuilding all apps\nnpm run
